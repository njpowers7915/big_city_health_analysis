# Big City Helath Analysis

The goal of this analysis is to identify factors that contribute to or detract from the overall health of a population. 
More specifically, I want to identify factors that impact obesity rates and physical activity levels. 
Identifying these factors can assist public policy makers in determening the best ways to allocate resources in order 
to incentivize people to lead healthier lifestyles.
